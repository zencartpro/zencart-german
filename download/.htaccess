# This is used with Apache WebServers
#
# The following blocks direct HTTP requests to all filetypes in this directory recursively, except certain approved exceptions
# It also prevents the ability of any scripts to run. No type of script, be it PHP, PERL or whatever, can normally be executed if ExecCGI is disabled.
# Will also prevent people from seeing what is in the dir. and any sub-directories
#
# For this to work, you must include either 'All' or all of these: 'Limit Options Indexes' parameters to the AllowOverride configuration in your apache/conf/httpd.conf file
# Example:
#<Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs">
#  AllowOverride Limit Options Indexes
#</Directory>

<FilesMatch ".*">

<FilesMatch ".*\.(zip|ZIP|gzip|pdf|PDF|mp3|MP3|swf|SWF)$">
  Order Allow,Deny
  Allow from all
  
  # tell all downloads to automatically be treated as "save as" instead of launching in an application directly
