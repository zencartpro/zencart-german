You have already unzipped this file or
else you wouldn't be reading this.  All
that remains now is to place the 'SimplyBlack'
folder and its contents into your templates
folder and select it in your Zen Cart admin
panel, Under Tools -->Template Selection.
Once you've done that select the boxes you
wish to appear in your left and right
columns from Tools --> Layout Boxes Controller.

Remember that all new templates, when first
installed do not have any boxes pre-selected.
