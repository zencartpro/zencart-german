<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>Recommendation:<br />
  First install the module in a test system. Configure, test and adapt it to your own design before adding to your live shop.<br />
</p>
<code>================= IMPORTANT =====================<br />
Before installing these changes:<br />
Make a BACKUP of shop and database.<br />
We accept no responsibility; use is at your own risk.<br />
Made a BACKUP? Ok, now read on...<br />
===============================================</code>
<ol>
  <li>    In the folder includes/templates, rename the folder YOURTEMPLATE to the template used in the shop (e.g. viennablood, classic, ...).</li>
  <li>    Upload all of the files in the folder 'includes' into the structure provided in the Zen Cart installation.<br />
    <strong>The following file is overwritten in the process:<br />
    <br />
    </strong><em>includes/classes/order.php<br />
    <br />
    </em>If changes have already been made to this file, make sure you compare the contents beforehand and enter the changes manually. The tool <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com" target="_blank">BeyondCompare</a> (the author's favourite tool..) is well-suited to this.</li>
  <li>    Upload all the files in the folder 'admin' into the structure provided in the Zen Cart installation.<br />
    <strong>  The following file is overwritten in the process:<br />
    <br />
    </strong><em>admin/orders.php<br />
    <br />
    </em>If changes have already been made to this file, make sure you compare the contents beforehand and enter the changes manually. The tool Winmerge is suitable for this.</li>
  <li>    Upload the folder 'pdf' into the main directory of the shop and set its folder permissions to chmod 777.<br />
    As the pdf invoices will be saved to this folder later, writing rights are required.</li>
  <li>    Upload the folder 'ajax' into the main directory of the shop.</li>
  <li>Zen-Cart Admin-Configuration-Attribute Settings<br />
    <br />
  WINDOWS servers:<br />
    &quot;Download by Redirect&quot; MUST be set to FALSE<br />
    Streaming - TRUE is better. See Zen Cart FAQ http://tutorials.zen-cart.com/index.php?article=292<br />
    <br />
    UNIX servers:<br />
    Admin-Configuration-Attribute Settings<br />
    If:<br />
    &quot;Download by Redirect&quot; is set to TRUE<br />
    then<br />
    the directory /catalog/pub MUST have read/write permissions 777 or 755<br />
    as a randomly-named folder is created in here from which is downloaded a copy of the pdf.</li>
  <li> When all the files have been uploaded, enter Zen Cart Administration and call up customers &gt; orders.<br />
    Now there is a new button there on the right, &quot;PDF invoice&quot;, during every order:<br />
    <br />
    <img src="graphics/button_en.jpg" alt="pdf Invoice Button" width="227" height="105" /></li>
  <li>    Click on this button during any order; in this way the necessary entries will be made in the database and the new menu item configuration &gt; pdf invoice 3 is opened. The configuration is already filled with functioning standard values. These values can then be adapted to one's needs later on; more on this in &quot;<a href="configuration_en.html">configuration</a>&quot;.</li>
  <li>Installation is now completed.<br />
    Now it would be good to try creating a pdf invoice and to choose an order again under customers &gt; orders and to click on the button &quot;PDF invoice&quot;.<br />
    If a pdf then opens with the name xxx.pdf (xxx=order number), everything is ok and the module is ready for use.</li>
  
</ol>
You can now adapt the module to your needs and carry on by reading &quot;<a href="configuration_en.html">configuration</a>&quot;.<br/>
