<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>Recommendation:<br />
  First install the module in a test system and configure/test it there and then finally adapt it to your own wishes.<br />
  Only then use it in a liveshop!</p>
<code>================= IMPORTANT =====================<br />
Before installing these changes:<br />
Make a BACKUP of shop and database.<br />
We accept no responsibility; use is at your own risk.<br />
Made a BACKUP? Ok, now read on...<br />
===============================================</code>
<p><br />
  1) <br />
  In the folder includes/templates, rename the folder YOURTEMPLATE to the template used in the shop (e.g. viennablood, classic, ...)</p>
<p>2) <br />
  Upload all of the files in the folder 'includes' into the structure provided in the Zen Cart installation.<br />
  The following file is overwritten in the process:</p>
<p><em>includes/classes/order.php</em></p>
<p>If changes have already been made to this file, make sure you compare the contents beforehand and enter the changes manually. The tool BeyondCompare (the author's favourite tool..) is well-suited to this.</p>
<p>3)<br />
  Upload all the files in the folder 'admin' into the structure provided in the Zen Cart installation. The following file is overwritten in the process:</p>
<p><em>admin/orders.php</em></p>
<p>If changes have already been made to this file, make sure you compare the contents beforehand and enter the changes manually. The tool Winmerge is suitable for this.</p>
<p>4)<br />
  Upload the folder 'pdf' into the main directory of the shop and set its folder permissions to chmod 777.<br />
  As the pdf invoices will be saved to this folder later, writing rights are required.</p>
<p>5)<br />
  When all the files have been uploaded, enter Zen Cart Administration and call up customers &gt; orders.<br />
  Now there is a new button there on the right, &quot;PDF invoice&quot;, during every order:<br />
  <br />
  <img src="graphics/button_en.jpg" alt="pdf Invoice Button" width="227" height="105" /></p>
<p>6) <br />
  Click on this button during any order; in this way the necessary entries will be made in the database and the new menu item configuration &gt; pdf invoice 3 is opened. The configuration is already filled with functioning standard values. These values can then be adapted to one's needs later on; more on this in &quot;<a href="configuration_en.html">configuration</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>7) <br />
  Installation is now completed.<br />
  Now it would be good to try creating a pdf invoice and to choose an order again under customers &gt; orders and to click on the button &quot;PDF invoice&quot;.<br />
  If a pdf then opens with the name xxx.pdf (xxx=order number), everything is ok and the module is ready for use.</p>
<p>8) <br />
  You can now adapt the module to your needs and carry on by reading &quot;<a href="configuration_en.html">configuration</a>&quot;.<br/>
