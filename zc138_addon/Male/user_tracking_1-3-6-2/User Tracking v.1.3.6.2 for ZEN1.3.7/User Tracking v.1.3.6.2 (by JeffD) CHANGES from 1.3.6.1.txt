User Tracking v.1.3.6.2 (UPDATE from v.1.3.6.1) 
Packaged by Woodymon 02-13-07

Regards to changes in User Tracking 1.3.6.2 120406 (JeffD) (Dec. 04, 2006), since 1.3.6.2 was not a regular release I am only including in this attachment changes from previous version: two changed files php plus the SQL patch and the readme.txt. I am hoping JeffD will be back with a full fileset User Tracking update in the future.

I'm running User Tracking v.1.3.6.2 (by JeffD) on Zen Cart 1.37 shop and it is working well. YMMV on other versions of Zen Cart.

BE SURE TO READ THE README!!!! No warranties implied. If you are not sure how to install this then best to stay with previous version.

REPEAT: ONLY the CHANGED User Tracking v.1.3.6.2 files are in this attachment. You will need JeffD's previous version 1.3.6.1 User Tracking installed for this to be useful to you.

Please post questions to the User Tracking mod support thread:

UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS:

If you have the previous version of User Tracking 1.3.6.1 installed then, besides updating your shop with the two new php files listed below, you only need to run following SQL patch (and not the full SQL patch file included in this attachment):

[code]INSERT INTO configuration VALUES ('', 'User Tracking (Show Product Category when tracking product clicks)', 'ZEN_CONFIG_SHOW_USER_TRACKING_CATEGORY', 'true', 'Show Product Category when tracking product clicks', 999, 60, '2006-12-05 11:19:26', '2006-12-05 21:20:07', NULL, 'zen_cfg_select_option(array(''true'', ''false''),');[/code]

Add your table prefix as required. (e.g. zen_configuration)
