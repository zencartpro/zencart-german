Module name:	Cross sell
Authors:		This module came from 2 separated modules (CrossSell and Advanced CrossSell). It was developed by many coders and users including Merlin and Absolute.
				I merely join the 2 modules togther, re-wrote most of the admin functions and add some more features.

All feedback appreciated! - Just contact me or post a message in the support thread.

1. This module needs another module called module_manager to operate properly.
http://code.google.com/p/zencart-module-manager/downloads/list

2. Make sure to change the name of the following directories (from the ZIP) to match your template name:
    /includes/modules/YOUR_TEMPLATE 
    /includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE 
    /includes/languages/english/YOUR_TEMPLATE

3. Upload all supplied files in their approporiate folder structure... EXCEPT for the following:
    /includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/templates/SAMPLE_ADDITION_TO_tpl_product_info_display_TEMPLATE_FILE.php
    /includes/languages/english/YOUR_TEMPLATE/SAMPLE_ADDITIONS_TO_product_info_LANGUAGE_FILE.php
   If you upload these example files, you may encounter template error messages due to the way overrides grab files.

   (Do not upload the install.txt or products_xsell.sql files, as they are not needed on the server.)

4. Open includes/languages/english/product_info.php 
   or includes/languages/english/YOUR_TEMPLATE/product_info.php 
   and add:
        define('TEXT_XSELL_PRODUCTS', 'We Also Recommend :');
   just above the final ?> and save it into includes/languages/english/YOUR_TEMPLATE/product_info.php 
   
   The SAMPLE_ADDITIONS_TO_product_info_LANGUAGE_FILE.php can be used for this by copying its contents into product_info.php

4.b. - Repeat step 4 for each of the other product types you intend to use (ie: product_music_info, document_general_info, etc).

5. Now edit your product-info template file (tpl_product_info_display.php) and insert the following code 
   at the point where you wish the Cross-Sell box to appear. Usually best at the end of the file:
   ---------------------------------
<?php
      require($template->get_template_dir('tpl_modules_xsell_products.php', DIR_WS_TEMPLATE, $current_page_base,'templates'). '/' . 'tpl_modules_xsell_products.php');
?>
   -------------------------------
   The SAMPLE_ADDITION_TO_tpl_product_info_display_TEMPLATE_FILE.php contains this same code, and you can copy/paste
   from that file into your customized tpl_product_info_display.php 
   
5.b. Repeat step 5 for any other product types for which you wish to enable cross-sell display.
     (ie: tpl_product_music_info_display.php, etc)

6. Upload your changes from step 4 / 4.b  and step 5 / 5.b to your server.   


Installation done.
