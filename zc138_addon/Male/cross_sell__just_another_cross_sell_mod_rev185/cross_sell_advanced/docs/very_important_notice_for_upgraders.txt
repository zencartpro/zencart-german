Starting from rev 185, this module now makes use of the module_manager.
If you have a previous version of the xsell module, you have to do this:
1. Back up, back up your database please!
2. Make sure you install the module manager first. Make sure it runs properly first!!!!
3. Use zencart sql patch tool to run this:
INSERT INTO module_version_tracker (module_code, patch_level, version_name) VALUES ('ri_jaxs', 2, 'Revision 185');

Now you can safely install this new version ^_^.

NOTE: You need to do this only ONCE. Say if you installed rev185, then later install rev200 (when it comes out), you dont need to go through this again.
But if your current version is one that doesnt use module manager (any version ealier than rev185), you need this.

If you want to check which version you are using, simply go to admin\includes\module_installation and see if there is a folder called "ri_jaxs", if it's not there you need to follow the instruction above.
